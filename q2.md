## Problem 2
- Why does an R1CS require exactly one multiplication per row? 
- How does this relate to bilinear pairings?

## Answer
- Suppose we have more than 1 multiplication per row
- The simplest example is `out = x*y*a`. If we formulate it as $Aw \cdot Bw = Cw$ and `w = [1 out x y a]` we are forced to leak one of the variable
    - `A = [0 0 1 0 0]`  
    - `B = [0 0 0 a 0]` 
    - `C = [0 1 0 0 0]`
- To avoid that, we will have to formulate it as $Aw \cdot Bw \cdot Cw = Dw$
    - `A = [0 0 1 0 0]`  
    - `B = [0 0 0 1 0]` 
    - `C = [0 0 0 0 1]`
    - `D = [0 1 0 0 0]`
- Recall (from q1) we multiply each matrix with a EC generator point and pair them 
- Pairing (A,B) results in points in G12 that cannot be paired with C
- Therefore we need to limit the multiplication to one per row
