## Problem 2
- Why does an R1CS require exactly one multiplication per row? 
- How does this relate to bilinear pairings?

## Answer
- Suppose we have more than 1 multiplication per row
- The simplest example is `out = x^2y`. There are two possible ways to formulate $Aw \cdot Bw = Cw$ 
- First, `w = [1 out x y]` and 
    - `A = [0 0 x 0]` 
    - `B = [0 0 0 1]` 
    - `C = [0 1 0 0]`
- But as `A, B, C` are out in the public, we will be leaking `x`
